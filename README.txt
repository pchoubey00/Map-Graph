Sarah Zaman created the Node, edge and graph classes. Synopsis: The code takes the text file and uses it to create a graph that has vertices and edges. The pathways are the edges and the vertices are the locations. It uses DijkstraÕs algorithm to calculate the shortest path from one point to another, the two points being given by the user.  This graph is then rendered on a JFrame and the shortest path is given in pink. Drawing the map takes O(|E|) --> O(|V|^2). This is because for every node in the list of vertices in the graph, drawing the x and y coordinates using longitudinal and latitudinal information takes O(1). Further, for each node in the adjacency list of this node, we calculate the x and y coordinates and draw a line that connects the need with its neighbouring nodes O(|E|/|V|). Notable Obstacles: * When we first tried to run our code, we could see the relevant information on the terminal, but the graphics would not show up. We made many changes, mostly calculations using longitude and latitude in order to make sure that we had the correct dimensions of the graph. We got the haversine formula from: https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Haversine_formula
